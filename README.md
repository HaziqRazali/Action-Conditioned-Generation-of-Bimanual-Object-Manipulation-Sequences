# Visualization
------------

  * To visualize a sample output as shown above, clone the repository and run the following commands.

```
cd ./datasets/kit_mocap/my_scripts/result_processing
python convert_to_mmm.py \
    --result_root "~/Action-Conditioned-Generation-of-Bimanual-Object-Manipulation/results" \
    --result_name "action2pose/kit_mocap/generation/combined"
./results/action2pose/kit_mocap/generation/combined/convert.sh
```

  * The commands above process the model's sample outputs in `./results/action2pose/kit_mocap/generation/combined` into a format viewable via the Master Motor Map. The processed files will be stored in `./datasets/my_scripts/result_processing/results/action2pose/kit_mocap/generation/combined`.

```
~/MMMTools/build/bin/MMMViewer
```

  * The command above launches the viewer. The processed files in `./datasets/my_scripts/result_processing/results/action2pose/kit_mocap/generation/combined` can then be selected for vizualization. The results can also be visualized as point clouds if MMM has not been installed.

# Training
------------

  * To train a model, download the [processed data](https://imperialcollegelondon.box.com/s/5spz4kwqbkgc18zndjsvhal1t09uce1f) then unzip it to `./data` as shown in [Brief Project Structure](#brief-project-structure) and run the following commands.

```
cd ./experiments/action2pose
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
    python "$HOME/Action-Conditioned-Generation-of-Bimanual-Object-Manipulation/train.py" \
    --args="args.action2pose" \
    --config_file="kit_mocap/generation/combined.ini"
```

  * The `run.sh` file in `./experiments/action2pose` also contain other commands for the various experiments. The weights will then be stored in `./weights`.

# Testing
------------

  * To test the model, run the following commands:

```
cd ./experiments/action2pose
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
    python "$HOME/Action-Conditioned-Generation-of-Bimanual-Object-Manipulation/test.py" \
    --args="args.action2pose" \
    --config_file="kit_mocap/generation/combined.ini" \
    batch_size=2 teacher_force_ratio=0.0
```

  * The `run.sh` file in `./experiments/action2pose` also contain other commands for the various experiments. The outputs will then be stored in `./results` that can be visualized by following the instructions listed in [Visualization](#visualization). Note that the `./weights` folder already contain a set of pretrained weights.
